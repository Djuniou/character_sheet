# Character_sheet
Personal project for an online RPG forum I play in.

I play in an online RPG forum with its own set of rules. This personal project aims to help the GameMasters with dice rolling for their players, hopefully making them spend more time typing the post than checking if the code to roll the dice is right.

## Objetives:
### Permanent stuff
These will always be stored with the character sheet. These are the character's base bonus.
- [x] Include attributes and HP/EN calculus
- [ ] Include combat style bonus
- [ ] Include advantages bonus
- [ ] Include equipment bonus
- [ ] Include three ways (haki,cyborg,akuma) - Only those that change the character sheet in a permanent way (A cyborg chest give 50+ HP, for example)
- [ ] Store all created characters in a file that the GM will be able to access through the programm so that the GM doesn't need to create the character everytime
### Temporary stuff
These will be added everytime the GM makes a roll. These options should be given to the GM and applied.
- [ ] Skills
- [ ] Status effects
- [ ] Combat Maneuver
### Interface
Build an easy-to-use interface.
- [ ] Brainstorm about how it should be and what it should have.
